## Dependencies:
 Sklearn, Matplotlib, pandas
 
## Best K?
  None of the K values appeared to be particularly advantageous compared to the other. This seems to be that for the dimensionality of this problem having larger k values does not significantly distort the iris data and thus the comparisons are still able to acurately predict the iris type of the flower.
